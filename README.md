# eda-tool-tkinter
This Python project provides a simple GUI-based tool for performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on CSV and Excel files. The application is built using the Tkinter library for the GUI and Pandas for data manipulation. The user can browse a file, and the tool will display summary statistics and a preview of the first 10 rows of the dataset.
